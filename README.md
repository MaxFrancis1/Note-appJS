# Note-appJS

This is my notes app I am making using JavaScript.

In this project I will be writing my own tests without libraries and writing the code without using other framework like **Jquery** for example.

### User stories

#### 1
As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
So I can find the one I want

#### 2
As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember

#### 3
As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
So I can see all the information in the note

*notes do not need to be permanently stored. If the user refreshes their web page, they'll lose their notes, and that's fine.*
